The purpose of this folder is to keep a clear and clean project of our game jam game as we (or I) polish it off and work out some of the bugs in it. Please keep track of all changes you make to this project in the game jam folder. In the coming days, I may configure a git server for this project to avoid any file conflicts.
Thanks,
Shane
