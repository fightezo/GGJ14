Stay! [GGJ14]
=====
A game created during the 2014 GGJ. That year's theme was “we don't see things as they are, we see them as we are”. We created a
local multi-player game involving two players (dog and its owner) who have advantages over one another and attempts to win.

Instructions: 
Human
Alternate between the hands when the dog tries to run off! HOLD ON!!

Dog
Alternate between the paws when animals, cars & stu7ff appear! RUN LOOSE!
