question:
players randomly pressing the buttons have no effect on the scores right?

we are thinking they may hurt the score, this is tenative.

PS:
I somewhat fixed my dogwalk folder, however the scores aren't tallying up.
could someone help me out?




guys. I won't be able to make it back in time for the presentation or whatever.
But I can still help out wtih some coding from where i am.
What else do we need?
